r Thomas Fuller,

I'm writing you to request minor changes to your submission, "Experimental
Celestial Navigation Prototype For Computer Vision Based Nautical Sight
Reduction".

There are a few format changes that are needed before this can be approved.

DONE -The date on the title and abstract should be September 2016
DONE -Margins should be 1 inch on both the left and right. There is no need to
alternate.
-Please follow the template for the committee page on pg 19 of the thesis
manual. Please note that there are no lines and no signatures on this page.
DONE- The preliminary page numbers are not correct. The title page counts as page
  i, and the committee page should be page ii, and so on.

To submit your changes, please go to the following page:
